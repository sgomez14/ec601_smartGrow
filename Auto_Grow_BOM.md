<h2>pH Meter</h2>  
Probably one of the most expensive components that is the hardest to DIY, this costs ~$29 for V1 and ~$39 for V2. It is also fairly important to have for a hydroponics setup, since there is no soil to act as a buffer for the plant.

<h2>Teensy 4.1</h2>  
Brains of the operation. These are very powerful MCUs with very good support & programmability.

<h2>Humidity & Temperature Sensor</h2>  
From Adafruit, the DHT22 is a low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It can only poll data every couple of seconds, but for this application that is sufficient, especially considering the low price and ease of expanding larger modules with additional sensors.

<h2>Light Sensor</h2>  
VEML7700

<h2>Servos</h2>  
These are needed to open & close the drainage connections to each hydroponics unit, allowing water to be replaced within each module. The alternative would be another peristaltic pump, which may be too slow.  
*Link:  Product TBD*  

<h2>Peristaltic Liquid Pump</h2>
These will be used to safely (*following food safety regulations*) pump water from either the water reservoir to a module's hydroponics, or from the nutrient supply to the hydroponics chamber.

<h2>Relays</h2>  
Numerous devices use 12v power, so a relay is needed to control these higher voltage devices.

<h2>Grow Lights</h2>  
Once again, controlled via a relay. These could be replaced by higher quality alternatives, but for this project we are using standard A19 bulbs.

<h2>HVAC</h2>  
This project assumes no odour control is needed. Airflow is still crucial for controlling humidity, temperature, and oxygen to root zones.  
*Link: TBD, probably computer fans I have around.*  

<h2>Humidifier</h2>
Exact product TBD, but something like this.
